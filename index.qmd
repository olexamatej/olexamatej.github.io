I'm a student at **Brno University of Technology**, and I like cybersecurity 🕵️.

## CTF writeups 🚩
Here are some of my CTF solutions and writeups 🔥✍️:  
- [webhacking.kr](https://github.com/olexamatej/webhacking.kr)  
- [picoCTF](https://github.com/olexamatej/picoctf)  
- [pwnable.kr](https://github.com/olexamatej/pwnable.kr)  
- [LACTF 2025](https://github.com/olexamatej/lactf2025)  
- [misc-ctfs](https://github.com/olexamatej/misc-ctfs) — a mixture of CTFs where I didn’t feel like writeupping many challenges, but still contributed and placed somewhere

For deeper walkthroughs of two of my favourite challenges from **Cyber Apocalypse 2025** (where we placed in the top 2%), check out these posts. I didn’t have time to finish the other writeups, but these go into the techniques and thought process I followed:
